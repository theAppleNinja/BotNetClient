# BotNetClient
This is the botnot client code I wrote as a PoC in cooperation with AT&amp;T Labs Research to prototype new attack vectors from IoT devices such as Wii Game Console back in 2009.  Keep in mind this was cutting edge research at the time and term IoT was not invented yet.  We referred to it as "Intelligent Electronics Devices" in the paper. :)

My work was presented at the December 2010 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference below.
